      We hope you like them and as always you're free to use them
      however you wish, as long as that's OK with Apple. Is that
      OK with you, Steve?

      If you like this and any of our other icon work we always
      appreciate a link back. If you really like this and our other
      icons, please consider giving us a little monetary incentive
      for us to produce another set in the near future. You'll be
      glad you did, we promise!
